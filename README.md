# nasa_apod
Nasa Picture of The Day Archive downloader

You'll need urllib, httplib2, and BeautifulSoup installed to use this script.
It is PRETTY far from perfect, but downloads most of the links (more than 7000 of the files from the last 20 years).
Next steps should be:
  - cleaning the script so as to look for all the correct pics from the apod site only.
  - providing automatically the name for the file with the correct year, date and title.
  - making sure only the the higher quality file is downloaded instead of doubles.
